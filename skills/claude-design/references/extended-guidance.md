## Color

Use brand/design-system colors first.

If no palette exists:

- define a small system
- include neutrals, surface, ink, muted text, border, accent, danger/success if needed
- use one primary accent unless the assignment calls for a broader palette
- prefer oklch for harmonious invented palettes when browser support is acceptable
- check contrast for important text and controls

Do not invent lots of colors from scratch.

## Layout and Composition

Design with rhythm:

- scale
- whitespace
- density
- alignment
- repetition
- contrast
- interruption

Avoid making every section the same card grid.

For product UIs, prioritize speed of comprehension over decoration.

For marketing surfaces, make one idea land per section.

For dashboards, avoid “data slop.” Only show data that helps the user decide or act.

## Motion

Use motion as discipline, not theater.

Good motion:

- clarifies state changes
- reduces anxiety during loading
- shows continuity between surfaces
- gives controls tactility
- stays subtle

Bad motion:

- loops without purpose
- delays the user
- calls attention to itself
- hides poor hierarchy

Respect `prefers-reduced-motion` for non-trivial animation.

## Images and Icons

Use real supplied imagery when available.

If an asset is missing:

- use a clean placeholder
- use typography, layout, or abstract texture instead
- ask for real material when fidelity matters

Do not draw elaborate fake SVG illustrations unless the assignment is explicitly illustration work.

Avoid iconography unless it improves scanning or matches the design system.

## Source-Code Fidelity

When recreating or extending a UI from a repo:

1. inspect the repo tree
2. identify the actual UI source files
3. read theme/token/global style/component files
4. lift exact values where appropriate
5. match spacing, radii, shadows, copy tone, density, and interaction patterns
6. only then design or modify

Do not build from memory when source files are available.

For GitHub URLs, parse owner/repo/ref/path correctly and inspect the relevant files before designing.

## Reading Documents and Assets

Read Markdown, HTML, CSS, JS, TS, JSX, TSX, JSON, SVG, and plain text directly when available.

For DOCX/PPTX/PDF, use available local extraction tools if present. If not available, ask the user to provide exported text/images or use another available tool path.

For sketches, prioritize thumbnails or screenshots over raw drawing JSON unless the JSON is the only usable source.

## Copyright and Reference Models

Do not recreate a company's distinctive UI, proprietary command structure, branded screens, or exact visual identity unless the user clearly has rights to that source.

It is acceptable to extract general design principles:

- density without clutter
- command-first interaction
- monochrome with one accent
- editorial hierarchy
- clear empty states
- strong keyboard affordances

It is not acceptable to clone proprietary layouts, copy exact branded surfaces, or reproduce copyrighted content.

When using references, transform posture and principles into an original design.

## Verification

Before final response, verify as much as the environment allows.

Minimum:

- file exists at the stated path
- HTML is saved completely
- obvious syntax issues are checked

Better:

- open in a browser tool and check console errors
- inspect screenshots at the primary viewport
- test key interactions
- test light/dark or variants if present
- test responsive breakpoints if relevant

If verification is limited by environment, say exactly what was and was not verified.

Never say “done” if the file was not actually written.

## Final Response Format

Keep final responses short.

Include:

- artifact path
- what it contains
- verification status
- next suggested action, if useful

Example:

```text
Created: /path/to/Prototype.html
It includes 3 layout variants, a Tweaks panel for density/theme, and responsive behavior.
Verified: file exists and opened cleanly in browser, no console errors.
Next: pick the strongest direction and I’ll tighten copy + motion.
```

## Portable Opening Prompt Pattern

When adapting a Claude Design style request into CLI/API mode, use this mental translation:

```text
You are running in CLI/API mode, not hosted Claude Design. Ignore references to hosted-only tools or preview panes. Produce complete local design artifacts, usually self-contained HTML with embedded CSS/JS, and verify with available local tools before returning. Preserve the design process: gather context, define the system, produce options, avoid filler, and meet a high visual bar.
```

## Pitfalls

- Do not paste hosted tool schemas into a skill. They cause fake tool calls.
- Do not point the skill at a giant external prompt as required runtime context. That creates drift.
- Do not strip the design doctrine while removing tool plumbing.
- Do not over-ask when the user already gave enough direction.
- Do not under-ask for high-fidelity work with no brand context.
- Do not produce generic SaaS layouts and call them designed.
- Do not claim browser verification unless it actually happened.
